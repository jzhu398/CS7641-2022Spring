Come here to download twitch_gamers dataset and bike_share_demand dataset. Here are links: (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_gamers.html) and (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview). Twitch_gamer download structure should include large_twitch_edges.csv, large_twitch_features.csv, and README.txt. bike_share_demand download structure should include train.csv and test.csv.

Come here to download all py files. Here is the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LU8M-zZDrKaFaWlQMJmFxvUvDVGUgPIj?usp=sharing

Description: There are two folders named as twitch_gamer and bike_share in code_hw1 folder. 

In twitch_gamer folder, there are five py files named as dtcode_hw1, nncode_hw1, knncode_hw1, svmcode_hw1, and boostcode_hw1. Before running the py script, twitch_gamer data should be put in the same dictionary and please make sure that you have right version pandas, numpy, and sklearn installed. Then run "python <name>.py in the right environment like "python dtcode_hw1.py". It should return best parameters and different graphs.

The same logic applies to bike_share folder. In bike_share folder, there are five py files named as dtcode_hw1_1, nncode_hw1_1, knncode_hw1_1, svmcode_hw1_1, and boostcode_hw1_1. Before running the py script, twitch_gamer data should be put in the same dictionary and please make sure that you have right version pandas, numpy, and sklearn installed. Then run "python <name>.py in the right environment like "python dtcode_hw1_1.py". It should return best parameters and different graphs.

Finally, running all py files is needed. Then results will be showed in you shell.
